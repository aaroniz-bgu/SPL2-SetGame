# SET: A Game of Visual Perception and Quick Thinking
SET is a fast-paced card game that challenges players to find sets of three cards.
But there's a twist! Each card has three features - shape, number, and shading - and these features can be either all the same or all different within a set.
The first player to spot a valid set shouts "SET" and claims the cards. Be quick and attentive, as there's no turn-taking and the game can get intense!
It's a great way to sharpen your visual perception and mental agility, making it perfect for individuals or groups of all ages.
